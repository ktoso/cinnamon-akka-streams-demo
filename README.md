## Running the sample

Start up the docker sandbox, with Prometheus, Grafana, and Zipkin:

```
cd sandbox
docker-compose up
```

> Note: the Prometheus sandbox is configured for Docker for Mac. Since Prometheus needs an address to scrape from, the Prometheus configuration will need to be updated for other platforms. 

Run the demo application:

```
sbt run
```

### Metrics

Metrics will be available in Grafana:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Sign in with `admin` / `admin`. Enable the Cinnamon Prometheus app. View dashboards for Akka Streams and Scala Futures.

### Traces
